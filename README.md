# firmware_AIDA
Firmware for the AIDA TLU Hardware

This repository contains the VHL used to generate the firmware for the AIDA TLU, both versions V1C (T-shaped pcb) and V1E (rectangular PCB; the one most likely to be used outside the UoB lab).

# Scripts
The repository also contains Python scripts used to test the hardware. These scripts rely on a few libraries not linked here, so they are unlikely to work "out of the box".
